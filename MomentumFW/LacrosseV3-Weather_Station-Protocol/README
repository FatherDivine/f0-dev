The .c and .h files go in applications/external/weather_station/protocols. That's for all firmwares. and then you can build it from the root with

./fbt launch APPSRC=weather_station

which will build and place it on the flipper that's connected automatically. or you can just build (with or without launch) and place the fap yourself. that is created in "build/f7-firmware-C/.extapps/weather_station.fap "
