So far, the first project will be generating sophisticated American Portals for EvilPortal. This means instead of using the EvilPortal Generator for a generic portal, I will capture genuine portals and do  html hacks to keep the size below  20KB as required by EvilPortal. These portal will be based upon portal found in major American cities.
